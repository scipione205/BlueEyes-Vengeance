# "BlueEyes with a Vengeance"

Opens Source Motion Picture Project

Near, privatized future. A girl steps into five criminals during a night walk and is going to be raped, when a superhero girl save her with martial arts and some good 80's lines.

That is a part of the upcoming series "True Evil", an Open Source Motion Picture Project which will be shot entirely on film.
